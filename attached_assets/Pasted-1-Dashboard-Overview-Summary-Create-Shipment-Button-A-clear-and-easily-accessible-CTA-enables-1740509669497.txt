Main sections needed:
Dashboard
Shipments
Bookings
Transactions (labeled as "Payments" in the detailed description)
Insights (related to "Reports" in the description)
Facilities
Users
Support
Settings/Profile
Log Out
The Dashboard should include:

Overall structure considerations:
Responsive design
Accessibility
Semantic HTML
Clear section labeling

Placeholders for content

I'll create a structure with:


A header with logo and top navigation
A sidebar for main navigation
A main content area that changes based on the selected section
For the initial view, I'll show the Dashboard section with all its components
This HTML structure provides a comprehensive logistics web application with all the required sections. The code includes:


A responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
A sidebar navigation for switching between main sections
A detailed dashboard with key metrics, shipment tracking, and notifications
Tabs for sub-navigation within sections
Properly labeled sections with semantic HTML elements
